## Windows 10 CPU Data (w_10_cpu_data)

The Windows 10 CPU dataset is utilized to predict CPU failure in fog nodes. The data undergoes preprocessing, including data type conversion and handling missing values. A neural network model is trained and evaluated for its predictive capabilities.

## Windows 10 Network Data (w_10_net_data)

The Windows 10 Network dataset is employed to predict network-related failures in fog nodes. Similar to the CPU data, preprocessing is performed, and a neural network model is trained for prediction.

## Windows 7 CPU Data (w_7_cpu_data)

This section involves the analysis of CPU data for Windows 7 fog nodes. The dataset is preprocessed, and a neural network model is trained to predict CPU failures on Windows 7.

## Windows 7 Network Data (w_7_net_data)

The Windows 7 Network dataset is used for predicting network-related failures on Windows 7 fog nodes. The data undergoes preprocessing, and a neural network model is trained for this purpose.
